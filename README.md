# Caesar Salad: a decipherer

## How It Works
This command-line Python decipherer uses natural language processing to automatically decipher encrypted messages without requiring a key input.

By analyzing the ciphertext and leveraging linguistic patterns (AKA frequently used words), the program determines the most probable decryption key and produces the corresponding plaintext.

## ToDo
- [ ] Optimise using letter distribution
- [ ] Add more languages (suggestions are welcome!)

## Limitations
The program currently only supports uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Other characters will be left unchanged.
